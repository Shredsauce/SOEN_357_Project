# Conclusion

This project allowed us to gain valuable insight into the work and thought that goes into UI/UX design. The added challenge of making design choices that would strengthen AI trust and transparency gave us the opportunity to focus more on user perspectives and frustrations.
Overall, the main challenge was ensuring that our product had enough features to encourage trust in the appâ€™s AI content through our design choices while not overwhelming non-technical users with unnecessary information. To examine existing solutions and get an idea of what worked/needed to be improved, we conducted market research along with distributing questionnaires and conducting interviews. Through our human-focused approach, we were able to make choices that resulted in a user-friendly, informative design.
