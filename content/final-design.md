# Final Design

The final design of an app in UI design is crucial for creating a successful and user-centric application that meets the needs and expectations of its target audience. 
We chose teal, persian green, black and white color palette and went for a minimalistic look. The colors give a professional look to the app and the minimalistic design keeps everything straightforward, enhancing user experience and building trust and transparency. 

## Color Palette

## Typography
For the font styles used in the app, we wanted to select a font that was visually appealing and professional. Fonts such as Arial and Open Sans are clean, simple and sans-serif, which increases their clarity and readability. This makes them perfect for a product like ours, where it is important not to overwhelm the user, given their concerns with the AI aspect. In the end, we selected Arial as our app’s font.

## Naming and Logo
To name our app, we chose between HireIQ and HireIQ.ai. In the end, we selected HireIQ, as we felt HireIQ.ai was a bit too long and we didn’t want this to intimidate potential users. For our logo, we wanted a simple, modern design that clearly indicated the employment support aspect of our app while also referencing the use of AI in the app. As such, we chose a design of a briefcase with features that resembled the head of a robot.
