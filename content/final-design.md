# Final Design

The final design of an app in UI design is crucial for creating a successful and user-centric application that meets the needs and expectations of its target audience. 
We chose teal, persian green, black and white scolor palette and went for a minimalistic look. The colors give a professional look to the app and the minimalistic design keeps everything straight forward enhancing user expereince, building trust and transparency.
