## Market Research

Employment-support apps are primarily focused on providing services to persons searching for jobs and companies/persons offering jobs. The former includes young professionals searching for internships/first jobs, unemployed persons looking to secure a job, and working persons looking for a career switch. The latter includes persons such as recruiters, hiring managers and HR professionals. Currently, there are a number of AI-powered employment support products aimed at assisting people in these roles to find/fill job positions. Each has its own way of promoting transparency and trust in its AI among its users. However, some offer more insight into/control of their AI’s process than others which can be an issue for some users.

## User Research

In order to fully understand our target users and design an app that would meet their needs and maintain their sense of trust and privacy, we created and distributed a survey. This survey focused on gathering information about:

• What products our user base was currently using
• What needs were/were not currently being met by our competitors
• What experience our target users had with AI-powered employment support applications
• Our target users’ concerns with using AI-powered employment support applications
• How we could meet the level of AI transparency desired by our target users to maintain their trust

We divided our survey into 3 main sections: questions for “job seekers”, questions for hiring personnel and general questions about how we could promote AI transparency/trust in our application. The result of this investigation is as follows:

### Job Seekers

Through our survey, we discovered that, the majority of respondents use the same AI-powered employment support applications: 47% use LinkedIn AI-Powered Job Search/Writing Assistant and 41% use Indeed Career Scout. An almost equal number of respondents had never used an application of this type.

</p>
<p align="center">
  <i>Figure 1: Job seekers experience with AI-powered employment support tools</i>
</p>

Job seekers were reportedly mainly using these products to find appropriate job postings (59%) and prepare for subsequent job interviews (41%). This is in comparison to features such as resume/cover letter creation/editing (6%) and tracking job applications (12%) that were used by a smaller subset of job seekers.

</p>
<p align="center">
  <i>Figure 2: Job seekers use of AI-powered employment support tools</i>
</p>

Consequently, most of the respondents (93% in total) stated that for a potential AI-powered app, they would like it to be capable of finding them relevant job postings and helping them prepare for interviews.

</p>
<p align="center">

### Hiring Personnel

Our survey also revealed that for hiring personnel, HireVue was the most popular application with 71% of respondents using it in comparison to Fetcher’s 29% and Pinpoint’s 14% . Respondents also reported that the hardest part of their recruitment process was screening candidates’ resumes/cover letters (100%) and sourcing candidates that meet requirements (71%).

</p>
<p align="center">
  <i>Figure 5: Hiring personnel’s biggest challenges in the job recruitment process</i>
</p>

86% of respondents claimed that they only used AI-powered employment tools to screen resumes and cover letters while the remaining candidates reportedly had never used a tool of this type. However, 86% of respondents said they would like a potential AI app to be able to help with the screening of documents and 100% said they would like it to help with sourcing candidates, while none wanted an AI tool that could assess job interviews. This indicated to us that there was a gap in what the users wanted and what they were being offered by their preferred AI tools.

</p>
<p align="center">
  <i>Figure 7: Features hiring personnel want in an AI tool</i>
</p>

As a result of these responses, we focused our efforts on matching the features in the products that our target audience was using while adding extra needed functionality.

### Promoting AI Transparency and Trust

The final part of our survey focused on identify what our target users’ concerns with AI-powered employment support applications were and how we could address them. For the majority of respondents, lack of human over sight (71%) and lack of explanations for decisions (58%) were the biggest concerns.

<p align="center">
  <img width="652" height="305" alt="image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shredsauce/SOEN_357_Project/main/assets/images/ua-bbc9f26e9fb0c261.png" />
</p>
<p align="center">
  <i>Figure 8: Concerns target users have with AI tools for employment support</i>
</p>

Unsurprisingly, this led to most respondents indicating that in-depth explanations of how the AI works and what data it used for its decisions would increase their trust for the app. Respondents also indicated they would appreciate clear labelling of AI decisions in-app.

# Quotes from participants

Some quotes that we gathered from participants are as follows:

<div style="display:grid; gap:16px; grid-template-columns:repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr)); margin-top:12px;">
  <blockquote style="margin:0; padding:16px 20px; border-radius:12px; background:#f9fafb; border:1px solid #e5e7eb; color:#111827;">
    <span style="font-size:28px; line-height:0; color:#9ca3af;">“</span>
    Having clear, explainable AI decisions helps me hire fairly, save time, and show my company that every candidate was evaluated with transparency and respect.

    I just want to know my skills are seen and valued and not lost in an automated system that doesn’t explain why I was rejected.

    I’m trying to land my first role, so it’s frustrating when AI filters me out without feedback or understanding that my skills can grow.
