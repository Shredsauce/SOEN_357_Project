## Market Research

Employment-support apps are primarily focused on providing services to persons searching for jobs and companies/persons offering jobs. The former includes young professionals searching for internships/first jobs, unemployed persons looking to secure a job, and working persons looking for a career switch. The latter includes persons such as recruiters, hiring managers and HR professionals. Currently, there are a number of AI-powered employment support products aimed at assisting people in these roles to find/fill job positions. Each has its own way of promoting transparency and trust in its AI among its users. However, some offer more insight into/control of their AI’s process than others which can be an issue for some users.
