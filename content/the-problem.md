# Understanding the problem

Finding and securing meaningful employment can be overwhelming, especially for job seekers who lack the necessary connections. Theyâ€™re not always able to tailor their applications or find the right opportunities. At the same time, hiring managers often face the challenge of going through large amounts of resumes and ensuring fair candidate evaluation. While AI-powered tools have the potential to simplify these processes by analyzing resumes, suggesting relevant skills or ranking candidates, trust remains a critical barrier. Many users worry about how AI makes its decisions. They worry about it being biased or whether it may potentially overlook qualified candidates. Existing employment platforms that use AI tend to focus on speed and automation but rarely explain their recommendations to non-technical users. This lack of clarity can lead to mistrust, overreliance and skewed rankings that may not truly reflect candidates. A tool that clearly communicates how its AI analyzes resumes, recommends skills and evaluates candidates while giving users the choice to enable or disable AI assistance is needed to help both job seekers and employers to feel informed, empowered and in control.
