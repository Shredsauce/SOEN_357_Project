## Project Introduction

**HireIQ** is an AI-powered employment platform designed to bring transparency, fairness, and trust to the hiring process. Similar to platforms like LinkedIn, HireIQ helps job seekers connect with employers and discover relevant opportunities but with a crucial difference: it emphasizes AI explainability.

We aim to make AI-driven recommendations and evaluations clear and understandable to all users. Job seekers can see how AI analyzes their resumes, recommends skills, and ranks opportunities. Employers, on the other hand, gain insights into why certain candidates are prioritized. This transparency empowers both sides to make informed decisions while fostering trust in AI systems.

By introducing AI transparency for employment-focused social media platforms, HireIQ bridges the gap between automation and accountability, ensuring that technology remains fair, inclusive, and easy to trust.

# Understanding the problem

Finding and securing meaningful employment can be overwhelming, especially for job seekers who lack the necessary connections. They’re not always able to tailor their applications or find the right opportunities. At the same time, hiring managers often face the challenge of going through large amounts of resumes and ensuring fair candidate evaluation. While AI-powered tools have the potential to simplify these processes by analyzing resumes, suggesting relevant skills or ranking candidates, trust remains a critical barrier. Many users worry about how AI makes its decisions. They worry about it being biased or whether it may potentially overlook qualified candidates. Existing employment platforms that use AI tend to focus on speed and automation but rarely explain their recommendations to non-technical users. This lack of clarity can lead to mistrust, overreliance and skewed rankings that may not truly reflect candidates. A tool that clearly communicates how its AI analyzes resumes, recommends skills and evaluates candidates while giving users the choice to enable or disable AI assistance is needed to help both job seekers and employers to feel informed, empowered and in control.
